# Network-Speed-Test

## 🚀 Welcome to ByteStorm's Network Speed Test Project!

🎯 **About the Project:**
ByteStorm's Network Speed Test is a powerful and efficient Python-based network speed testing tool.
It allows you to measure data transfer speeds over TCP and UDP protocols while collecting detailed performance metrics like transfer speed and packet success rate.

📡 **Key Features:**

- ✅ Real-time UDP and TCP speed testing.
- ✅ Multi-threaded for accurate performance testing.
- ✅ Clear performance statistics and results.
- ✅ Dynamic server discovery via UDP broadcast.

📊 **Statistics and Insights:**
The system will provide insights like:
- Transfer speed in bits/second
- Packet success rate
- Time taken for transfer completion
